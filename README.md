# WebViewer Digital Signature Demo

This is a sample ASP.NET Core Razor Pages project demonstrating how to digitally sign PDFs using [Apryse WebViewer](https://apryse.com/webviewer) and a `.pfx` digital certificate. 
It allows users to place a signature field on a PDF and sign it with cryptographic identity details (e.g., name and email) extracted from the PFX file.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Embed Apryse WebViewer in an ASP.NET Core Razor Page
- Allow users to place a signature field on a PDF
- Digitally sign the field using a `.pfx` certificate
- Extract certificate metadata (e.g. CN and email) to display in the signature appearance
- Save and download the signed PDF with the digital signature applied
